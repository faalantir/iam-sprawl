## üí° About

 
 
### _"How I reduced S3 permissions by 90% in 2 minutes."_

This started as a weekend experiment to answer one simple question: 

> ‚ÄúHow many of my IAM roles still have `*` in their policies?‚Äù

I was curious, so I wrote a quick script ‚Äî and it turned into a small tool that makes those findings **visible, actionable, and easy to review**.

It runs locally, uses your existing AWS credentials, and is completely free.

Obviously, full IAM analyzers can do thousands of things, but sometimes you just want something **simple and focused**, without clicking through endless AWS console screens.
  

It‚Äôs not meant to replace enterprise tools ‚Äî just to give you **clarity in two minutes**.

```  
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install  dependencies

```bash
pip install  fastapi  uvicorn  jinja2  boto3
```
###  3Ô∏è‚É£ Run  the  scan
#####
```bash
Export your AWS_PROFILE or ensure your defaault IAM user has atleast following read permissions
(`iam:ListRoles`, `iam:ListUsers`, `iam:ListGroups` `iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies`, `iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies`, `iam:ListAttachedGroupPolicies`  `iam:ListRolePolicies`, `iam:ListUserPolicies`, `iam:ListGroupPolicies` `iam:GetRolePolicy`, `iam:GetUserPolicy`, `iam:GetGroupPolicy` `iam:GetPolicy`, `iam:GetPolicyVersion`  `cloudtrail:LookupEvents` )

# This will generate report.json file
python iam_sprawl_scanner.py
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start  the  dashboard
```bash
# This starts the uvicorn server and reads the report.json file, generated above.
python app.py 
```

Then open  http://localhost:8000

  

That‚Äôs it  ‚Äî  runs  locally  using  your  existing  AWS  credentials (like awscli).

### ü§ù Why  Share  This

IAM sprawl  is  something  everyone  hits  sooner  or  later.

This small  script  helped  me  see  my  own  landscape  clearly  ‚Äî  so  I  thought  others  might  find  it  useful  too.
If you  try  it,  let  me  know  what  you  think  or  what  you‚Äôd  improve.
